# Cube-Statistica-Course-Registrations
 Cube Statistica provides AI services and business solutions in machine learning, automation, data analytics and statistical consulting. In 2022, it provided a course on data science and machine learning. The course applications were registered via google forms. The dataset that was given to those who registered for the course was dataset obtained from google forms itself. The trainees were supposed to predict whether the applicant who fills the google form, do they end up paying the registration fee or not? 
This was a binary classification problem which required intense amount of data cleaning as many questions in the google forms were open-ended without any drop-down options. 80% of the project was spent on data cleaning. 
The data cleaning comprised of:
* Renaming Columns
* Removing Inconsistencies
* Imputing Missing Data
* Fixing Data Types and Data Range Constraints
* One_Hot_Encoding

KNN and Random forest classifier were used to measure the accuracy of the model.
